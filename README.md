## üõ†Ô∏è Quickstart

- I have hosted an instance on render so you can see it working (and for Connectathon'ers)

```
https://patient-dashboard-t065.onrender.com/
```

- To clone and run the original Davey Mason code...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daveymason/Patient-Dashboard-htmx-python-fhir.git
cd Patient-Dashboard-htmx-python-fhir
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask requests
python app.py
```
- To clone and run this fork of the repo...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjosborne1/Patient-Dashboard
cd Patient-Dashboard
# I use VS Code Create Python environment here, which is essentially...
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# IMPORTANT: BEFORE YOU RUN THE APP
# create a `.env` file in the root folder to contain your FHIR Server credentials (Basic Auth only). See below for an example. 
python app.py
```

- Example `.env` file, all values are fictitious of course
```
FHIR_USERNAME='Tester'
FHIR_PASSWORD='Password4Tester'
