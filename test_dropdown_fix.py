Test the fix for test selection dropdown - ensure clicking on specific option selects that option

ISSUE: When clicking on a test option in the dropdown, it was selecting the first 
option instead of the specific option that was clicked.

ROOT CAUSE: The click handler was calling addTestSelection() which would re-search 
the dropdown options and could match the first option instead of the clicked one.

FIX: Created a new addSpecificTestSelection(code, display) function that directly 
uses the code and display from the clicked option, avoiding any re-searching.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Click handler now calls addSpecificTestSelection(code, display) directly
2. This bypasses the search logic in addTestSelection()  
3. Ensures the exact clicked option's code and display are used

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- User clicks on "Histology test" with code "714797009" ‚Üí that specific test is added
- User clicks on "Blood glucose test" with code "33747000" ‚Üí that specific test is added
- No more incorrect first-option selection

The fix is in the JavaScript in diag_request.html:
- New addSpecificTestSelection() function for direct option selection
- Modified click handler to use the specific function
- Preserved addTestSelection() for keyboard/manual entry
