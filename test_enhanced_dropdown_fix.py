ISSUE UPDATE: Even after the previous fix, "Cytology histology correlation" 
was still being selected when clicking on "Histology test".

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. Multiple event listeners were being added to the same elements
2. Event bubbling from inner elements (spans, divs) to the parent anchor
3. Race conditions between different click handlers

ENHANCED FIX IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Removed individual event listener attachment in HTMX after-request
2. Implemented single delegated event listener using document.addEventListener
3. Used e.target.closest('.test-option') to handle event bubbling properly
4. Added e.stopPropagation() to prevent multiple handlers from firing
5. Added comprehensive debug logging to track the exact behavior

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
- Event delegation prevents duplicate listeners
- closest() method handles clicks on inner elements correctly  
- stopPropagation() prevents event bubbling issues
- Single point of control for all test option clicks

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- User clicks anywhere on "Histology test" option ‚Üí "Histology test" is selected
- User clicks anywhere on "Cytology histology correlation" ‚Üí that specific test is selected
- Debug logs in browser console will show exactly which option was clicked
- No more incorrect selection due to event handling conflicts

DEBUG STEPS:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type test names in the diagnostic request modal
4. Click on different options
5. Check console logs to verify correct option detection

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Uses document.addEventListener with event delegation
- Handles event bubbling with e.target.closest('.test-option')
- Prevents multiple event firing with e.stopPropagation()
- Maintains all existing keyboard navigation functionality
